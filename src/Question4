Q: If you use the same  PreAuthorize  configuration on  each method in a class, how can you
make the annotations cleaner?

A: @PreAuthorize checks for the value before calling the method it is annotated at.
 To make configuring the @PreAuthorize annotations cleaner, the annotation can be annotated at class level
 instead of method level.

 Example:
 @Service
 @PreAuthorize
 Public class Service {}
